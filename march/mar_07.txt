Aim: It's like this and like that and like this...

Event Propagation
	1. An element interrupts an event
	2. Browser collects DOM node path of the event from the starting element to the root
	3. Capture: The event propagates down the path from step 2
	4. Bubble: the event propagates up the path from step 2
