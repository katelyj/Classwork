CANVAS LAYOUT IN JAVASCRIPT:

(no negative coordinates)


javascript path functions
	- paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves
	- a context can keep track of one path at a time
	- the path is not drawn until stroke() is called
	- a path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called
	- example code
		var ctx = document.getElementById('slate').getContext('2d'); // set up canvas
		ctx.beginPath(); // begins path!
		ctx.moveTo(250, 150); // point at that coordinate, no line from original point
		ctx.lineTo(250, 250); // line from original point to that coordinate
		ctx.stroke(); // will show the line!
