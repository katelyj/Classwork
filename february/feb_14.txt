javascript path functions
	- paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves
	- a context can keep track of one path at a time
	- the path is not drawn until stroke() is called
	- a path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called
	- methods:
		- beginPath() --> starts or resets current path
		- moveTo(X, Y) --> moves the path to position (x, y), does not result in a line or filled in section
		- lineTo(X, Y) --> moves the path to position (x, y), will result in a line or filled in section
		- closePath() --> results in a line from the current position to the starting position
		- stroke() --> renders all the lines in the path, does not end the path
		- fill() --> fills the interior of the path, will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points in it
		- arc(X, Y, RADIUS, START, END) --> creates an arc path with center (x, y) with START and END as the defining angles in radians
	- example code:
		var ctx = document.getElementById('slate').getContext('2d'); // set up canvas
		ctx.beginPath(); // begins path, starts at origin by default
		ctx.moveTo(250, 150); // point at that coordinate, no line from original point
		ctx.lineTo(250, 250); // line from original point to that coordinate
		ctx.stroke(); // will show the line!
		ctx.arc(250, 150, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI); // will draw a circle at (250,150) with radius 50 from angle 0 to 2pi (the full circle)
		ctx.stroke() // will show the circle!
