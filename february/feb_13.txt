Aim: Canvasing the area

HTML5
	- Redesign of HTML with a focus on making the more "modern" features of web browsers easy to work with
	- Designed around javascript and a standardized DOM
	- Includes built in support for audio and video playback
	- Includes an element that can be directly drawn on

Canvas
	- HTML5 element that provides a drawing area
	- Javascript functions can draw onto a canvas element
	- You must declare what context you are drawing in
		- 2D drawing, 3D drawing, raw bitmap rendering
	- Give a canvas an ID so you can interact with javascript
