Aim: Documentmenting your data

NoSQL: Any database that is not an SQL database
	- Graph databases
	- Document-based databases
	- File system databases

Document-Oriented Database
	- Records in Document Oriented Databases are stored as documents
	- Each document contains all the data that is associated with the given record, in key-value pairs (fields)
	- You do not need to specify the type of data put into each field
	- Fields can contain many different kinds of data, including lists and dictionaries
	- Documents that are meant to be stored together are put into collections
	- Documents in the same collection do not need to have the same fields
