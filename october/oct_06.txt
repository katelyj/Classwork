Aim: URL binding is the art of redirection

In order for a session to be encrypted, we need to set a private key in our app:

	APP.secret_key = <RANDOM_STRING>

Good way to get random data:

	os.urandom(#) (# -->  # of bytes returned)

Remember to import session! (and url_for)

url_for
- Flask function that will build the correct url for a particular function
- print url_for(<functionName>) --> prints url for fxn

redirect
- Flask function that will redirect a call to one route to a different response
- Often used in combination with url_for
- Example:
	if "username" in session:
		return render_template("loggedIn.html")
	else:
		 return redirect(url_for("login"))

Session is NOT tied to flask app. Session is locally saved. Based on browser.
