COOKIES AND SESSIONS
- Cookies are files that websites will save to your web browser to store info on a local machine
- Useful for keeping track of persistent login credentials and info
- Saved locally, on your computer
- Sessions are securely signed cookies in flask
- Since they're encrypted, they cannot be modified by the user of the local machine
- Session object in Flask works exactly like a dictionary:
	- Add data: session[KEY] = DATA
	- Remove data: session.pop(KEY)
