Aim: WHERE did I put that data?

.tables --> see current tables

$ SELECT code, mark FROM courses;
$ SELECT name, students.id, mark FROM students, courses

WHERE
- Allows you to put restrictions on the results of a SELECT statement
- $ SELECT * FROM courses WHERE mark < 65;
- $ SELECT name, students.id, courses.id, code FROM students, courses, 
    WHERE students.id = courses.id
