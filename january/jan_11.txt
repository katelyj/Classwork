Aim: Defeating the Trojans with the help of Ajax

AJAX (Asynchronus Javascript And Xml)
	- System created to send data to a server in the background of a page without having to reload the page or wait for the server to acknowledge the change
	- Don't have to wait for the web server to respond, just continues working (so, order of code is irrelevant)
	- Combination of technologies including javascript, html, DOM, and XML
	- AJAX calls can send data to a server using GET or POST (for example), and then catch the data sent by the server in response
	- Originally, XML was the only supported format for sending/receiving data, but now many formats are used, inclusing JSON and plain text
	- AJAX calls can be made via the XMLHttpRequest javascript object (but kinda clunky)
	- Using jquery for AJAX:
		- The jquery library provides clean wrapper functions for making AJAX calls
		- $.ajax( <SETTINGS> );
		- Settings is an associative array containing all the information required to make the given ajax calls
		- Notable settings keys:
			- url: Server target link
			- type: Method ("POST" or "GET")
			- data: Data to be sent
			- success: Function to be called if the server responds
				- This function can take an argument if the server sends data in response
		- example call:
			$.ajax ({
			  url: '/foo',
			  type: 'GET',
			  data: "look, it's information!",
			  success: function(d) { 
			    console.log(d) }; (prints out whatever the server responded with in the console)
			  }
			});
