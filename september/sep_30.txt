Aim: Always serve your passwords with a side of hash browns

HASH FUNCTION
- Function designated to take in an arbitrary amount of data and return a fixed size sequence of bits called a "hash object"
- Like scrambling an egg... can never get the egg back
- Not reversable, but always get the same thing with a certain input

HASHING IN PYTHON
- import hashlib
- hashlib.md5('whatever') --> returns an object (series of bits)
- hashlib.md5('whatever').digest() --> represents those bits as characters
- hashlib.md5('whatever').hexdigest() --> ditto, but only with chars a-f and 1-9 (no weirdness)
