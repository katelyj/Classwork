Aim: Functioning tools

No functional programming toolbox would be complete without the following concepts:
	- Memoization
	- Map
	- Filter
	- Reduce

Memoization
	- Reducing the time it takes to complete an (often recursive) algorithm by saving previously computed values to be used later
	- Can be easily created using decorators
