Aim: After being framed, you might need to take a REST

Tips for using frameworks
	- Many files have .min equivalents, which contain the same code without any extra formatting... you don't need this! Not very useful.
	- jquery is a popular javascript library used in many frameworks
	- The order in which you include javascript files is important
	  When a web browser hits a script tag, it will download and parse the ENTIRE script before it moves on.
	- Javascript in <head> or at the end of <body> ?
		- Yet another programmer holy war... PICK EITHER!!!
		- Disadvantages to head: Takes longer to load
		- Disadvantages to body: Some elements of page may not load quick enough

REST APIs
	- API (Application Program Interface): A published set of protocols that can be used to have your program interact with another program/service
	- REST (Representational State Transfer): APIs that transmit data back after recieving an http[s] GET request
		- Returned data can be in various formats, most commonly html, xml, json
		- Example REST call: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=z50CLcXbxVpm5pJfALskk1aCWeBKRsNiFvBN1YYp
