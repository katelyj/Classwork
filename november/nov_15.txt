Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
	- Created to separate the presentation of an html/xml page and its contents
	- Basic syntax:
		- PROPERTY: VALUE;
		  color: lightsteelblue; (text color, always)
		  text-align: center;
		  border: 10px; (no space between number and unit)
	- 3 ways to incorporate CSS into a page: inline, internal style sheet, external style sheet
		- Inline CSS
			- Add CSS code to the style attribute of a tag
			- Probably used the least
			- <TAG style="CSS CODE">
			- <p style="color: green; font-size: 2em;"> ... </p> (em is a unit for font size)
		- Internal style sheet
			- Add a <style> element to the <head> section of the page
			- Include all your CSS code inside the <style> ... </style> block
			- Internal and external style sheets require the addition of a selector so that it's clear what element you are styling
			- SELECTOR {
				CSS CODE
			} 
			- <head>
			    <style>
				h1 {
					color: #FF00FF;
				}
			    </style>
			  </head>
		- External style sheet
			- Create a separate .css file that contains all your CSS code
			- It cannot contain any other kind of code, including html or xml
			- Include a link to the css file inside the <head> section of your page
			- <head>
				<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="STYLE FILE">
			  </head>
			- Commonly agreed as best method to implement CSS
